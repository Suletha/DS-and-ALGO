Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.





class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        set_bit=0
        while n:
            set_bit += n % 2
            n = n >> 1
        return set_bit
