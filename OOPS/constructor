Create a class named 'Student' with String variable 'name' and integer variable 'roll_no'. 

Create a constructor through which you can assign values through objects on creation of objects.

if No value is passed through object then by default name should be initialized to "john" and roll_no as 2



  class Student:
    
    def __init__(self,name = "john",roll_no = 2):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no
    
#Do not touch the Main method
def main():
    x=Student("vaibhav",101)
    print(x.name)
    y=Student("rahul",102)
    print(y.name)
    obj=Student()
    print(obj.name)

main()
