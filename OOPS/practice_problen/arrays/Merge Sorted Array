            nums1[last] = nums2[n-1]
            n, last = n-1, last-1



Sure, let's go through the loop step by step with an example:

Example:

python
Copy code
nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
m = 3
nums2 = [2, 4, 6]
n = 3
Step 1: Initialize variables and pointers

last = m + n - 1, so last = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
m = 3 and n = 3.
Step 2: Start the loop

Both m and n are greater than 0, so we enter the loop.
Step 3: Compare elements and place them in nums1

Compare nums1[m-1] = nums1[2] = 5 and nums2[n-1] = nums2[2] = 6.
Since 5 > 6, place 5 at nums1[last] which is nums1[5].
nums1 becomes [1, 3, 5, 0, 0, 5].
Step 4: Move the pointers

Decrement m to m = 2.
Decrement last to last = 4.
Step 5: Compare elements and place them in nums1

Compare nums1[m-1] = nums1[1] = 3 and nums2[n-1] = nums2[2] = 6.
Since 3 > 6, place 3 at nums1[last] which is nums1[4].
nums1 becomes [1, 3, 5, 0, 3, 5].
Step 6: Move the pointers

Decrement m to m = 1.
Decrement last to last = 3.
Step 7: Compare elements and place them in nums1

Compare nums1[m-1] = nums1[0] = 1 and nums2[n-1] = nums2[2] = 6.
Since 1 < 6, place 6 at nums1[last] which is nums1[3].
nums1 becomes [1, 3, 5, 6, 3, 5].
Step 8: Move the pointers

Decrement n to n = 2.
Decrement last to last = 2.
Step 9: Compare elements and place them in nums1

Compare nums1[m-1] = nums1[0] = 1 and nums2[n-1] = nums2[1] = 4.
Since 1 < 4, place 4 at nums1[last] which is nums1[2].
nums1 becomes [1, 3, 4, 6, 3, 5].
Step 10: Move the pointers

Decrement n to n = 1.
Decrement last to last = 1.
Step 11: Compare elements and place them in nums1

Compare nums1[m-1] = nums1[0] = 1 and nums2[n-1] = nums2[0] = 2.
Since 1 < 2, place 2 at nums1[last] which is nums1[1].
nums1 becomes [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5].
Step 12: Move the pointers

Decrement n to n = 0.
Decrement last to last = 0.
Step 13: The first loop ends

Since n is now 0, we exit the first loop.
Step 14: Copy remaining elements from nums2 to nums1

There are no remaining elements in nums1, so we do not enter the second loop.
The final nums1 becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

The merge function successfully merges nums1 and nums2 in non-decreasing order, using the two-pointer approach, and without requiring any additional space. The merging is done in-place, and the final merged array is stored in nums1.
