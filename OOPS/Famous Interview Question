Write a program to create a class count_objects and calculate the number of objects that has been created in realtime.

class count_objects:
    i = 0
    def __init__(self): 
        
        count_objects.i +=1
    
        
   
    
    #Write the code here


#Do Not change the Below code Method


def main():
    a = count_objects()
    b = count_objects()
    c = count_objects()
    print(count_objects.i)
    d = count_objects()
    print(count_objects.i)
    e = count_objects()
    print(count_objects.i)
main()
