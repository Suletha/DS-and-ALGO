Imagine you are running an online clothing store, and you want to implement a feature showing the number of items in your inventory currently available in a particular size. To do this, you have a sorted array of inventory items, each with a size attribute. You also have a list of sizes you want to check for availability.
You know that binary search is a very efficient way to find the number of items with a particular size in the array. So, you decide to write a function that takes in the inventory array and size, and returns the number of items in the inventory that have that size or larger size.
Can you implement the function using binary search?
Example 1:
Input:

inventory = [1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 7]

size = 3

Output: 11


def count_items_of_size_or_larger(inventory, size):
    left, right = 0, len(inventory) - 1
    count = 0

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if inventory[mid] >= size:
            count = len(inventory) - mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    return count
