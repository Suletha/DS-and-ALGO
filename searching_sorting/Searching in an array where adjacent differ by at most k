A step array is an array of integers where each element has a difference of at most k with its neighbor. Given a key x, we need to find the index value of x if multiple elements exist, and return the first occurrence of the key.

Example 1:

Input : arr[ ] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 6}, K = 1 
        and X = 6
Output : 2
Explanation:
In an array arr 6 is present at index 2.
So, return 2.

def search (arr, n, x, k) : 
    #Complete the functionfor 
    n = len(arr)
    pos = 0
    while pos < n:
        if arr[pos] == x:
            return pos
        
        diff = abs(arr[pos] - x)//k
        diff = max(1,diff)
        pos = pos + diff
    return -1
