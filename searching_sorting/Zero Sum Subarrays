You are given an array arr[] of size n. Find the total count of sub-arrays having their sum equal to 0

1)Brute Force Approach:
def findSubArrays(self,arr,n):
        #prefix_sum = {}  # To store prefix sums and their frequencies
        count = 0
        n = len(arr)
        for i in range(0,n):
            sub_sum = 0
            for j in range(i,n):
                sub_sum += arr[j]
                
                if sub_sum == 0:
                    count +=1
        return count
        
        #return: count of sub-arrays having their sum equal to 0
