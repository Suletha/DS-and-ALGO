You are given an array arr[] of size n. Find the total count of sub-arrays having their sum equal to 0

1)Brute Force Approach:
def findSubArrays(self,arr,n):
        #prefix_sum = {}  # To store prefix sums and their frequencies
        count = 0
        n = len(arr)
        for i in range(0,n):
            sub_sum = 0
            for j in range(i,n):
                sub_sum += arr[j]
                
                if sub_sum == 0:
                    count +=1
        return count
        
        #return: count of sub-arrays having their sum equal to 0

# Python program for printing the subarrays whose sum is zero using hashing
def ZeroSubarraySum(nums,N):
    # A hashtable is created which is used to store current subarray sum
    hashtable = {}
    # to store the starting and ending indices store the indices in the ans array 
    ans = []
    # helps in computing the sum of elements 
    currentsum = 0
    for i in range(N):
        # add the value of nums[i] to the current sum
        currentsum += nums[i]
        # if the current sum is zero then it means that there is a zero subarray sum with starting index as 0 and ending index as the current index.
        if currentsum  == 0:
            # append the values of indices into the ans array
            ans.append((0, i))
        
        ans1 = []
         
        # If sum already exists in the hashtable then there exists at-least one subarray which is ending at index i with zero subarray sum
        if currentsum in hashtable:
            # this helps in storing the indices
            ans1 = hashtable.get(currentsum)
            for k in range(len(ans1)):
                ans.append((ans1[k] + 1, i))
