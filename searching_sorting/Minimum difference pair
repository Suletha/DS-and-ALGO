Given an unsorted array, find the minimum difference between any pair in given array.
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2, 4, 5, 9, 7]
Output: 1
Explanation: Difference between 5 and 4 is 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3, 10, 8, 6]
Output: 2
Explanation: Difference between 8 and 6 is 2.

class Solution:
	def minimum_difference(self, nums):
		# Code here
		nums.sort()
		n = len(nums)
		min_dif = nums[n-1]
		for i in range(1,n):
		    if nums[i] - nums[i-1] < min_dif:
		        min_dif = nums[i] - nums[i-1]
		return min_dif
