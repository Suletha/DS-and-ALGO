Given a string S. For each index i(1<=i<=N-1), erase it if s[i] is equal to s[i-1] in the string.

Example 1:

Input:
S = aabb
Output:  ab 
Explanation: 'a' at 2nd position is
appearing 2nd time consecutively.
Similiar explanation for b at
4th position.


class Solution:
    def removeConsecutiveCharacter(self, S):
        # code here
        result = s[0]
        for i in range(1,len(s)):
            if s[i] != s[i-1]:
                result += s[i]
        return result
