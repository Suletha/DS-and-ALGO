Task details

Two strings are twin strings if 'a' of first string is equal to 'z' of second string , 'b' of first string is equal to 'y' of second string .

you have given only one string out of two you have to find its twin string

Example 1:
Input:
S = varun
Output: ezifm

Explanation: Twin string of "varun" will be "ezifm" since v->e , a->z , r->i , u->f and n->m.
 Example 2:
Input:
S = akshay
Output: zphszb
Explanation: Twin string of "akshay" will be "zphszb" since a->z , k->p , s->h , h->s , a->z and y->b.

def find_twin_string(input_string):
    twin_string = ""
    for char in input_string:
        if char.isalpha():
            # Check if the character is a letter
            # Calculate its corresponding twin character
            twin_char = chr(ord('a') + ord('z') - ord(char))
            twin_string += twin_char
        else:
            # If the character is not a letter, simply append it to the twin string
            twin_string += char
    return twin_string

# Example usage:
input_string = "varun"
twin_string = find_twin_string(input_string)
print(twin_string)  # Output: "ezifm"



To find the twin string for the given input string, you can follow these steps:

Initialize an empty string to store the twin string.
Iterate through each character in the input string.
For each character in the input string, find its corresponding character in the twin string based on the transformation rule (e.g., 'a' maps to 'z', 'b' maps to 'y', etc.).
Append the corresponding character to the twin string.
Finally, return the twin string.



ord(char) returns the ASCII value of the current character. For example, ord('v') returns 118.
ord('z') - ord(char) calculates the difference between the ASCII values of 'z' and the current character. For example, ord('z') - ord('v') results in 7.
ord('a') + (ord('z') - ord(char)) adds this difference to the ASCII value of 'a'. For example, ord('a') + 7 results in 104.
chr(...) converts this new ASCII value back to a character. For example, chr(104) corresponds to the character 'h'.
So, twin_char will contain the twin character for the current letter.
