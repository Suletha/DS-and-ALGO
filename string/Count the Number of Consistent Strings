You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.


class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        allowed_set = set(allowed)
        for word in words:
            is_consistent = True
            for char in word:
                if char not in allowed_set:
                    is_consistent = False
                    break
            if  is_consistent :
                count +=1
        return count
