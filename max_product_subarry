Certainly! Let's walk through the code with the example nums = [2, 3, -2, 4] to understand how it finds the maximum product of a contiguous subarray:

Initialize the length of nums to n = 4.

Initialize two lists, max_product and min_product, with the first element of nums, which is 2.

In the given code, [nums[0]] * n is used to create a list of length n with all elements initialized to the value of nums[0].

Let's break it down using an example:

Suppose we have nums = [2, 3, -2, 4] and n = 4.

The expression [nums[0]] * n will create a list where all elements are copies of nums[0], which is 2 in this case.

So [nums[0]] * n becomes [2] * 4, which evaluates to [2, 2, 2, 2]. The resulting list has a length of n (4) and all elements are equal to 2.

In general, [nums[0]] * n is a concise way to create a list of length n with all elements initialized to the same value as nums[0].

max_product = [2, 2, 2, 2]
min_product = [2, 2, 2, 2]
Start iterating through the elements of nums starting from the second element (3) using the range from 1 to n (exclusive).

For i = 1, calculate the maximum and minimum product of contiguous subarrays ending at position i.

max_product[i] = max(3, max_product[0] * 3, min_product[0] * 3) = max(3, 2 * 3, 2 * 3) = 6
min_product[i] = min(3, max_product[0] * 3, min_product[0] * 3) = min(3, 2 * 3, 2 * 3) = 3
After the first iteration, the lists become:

max_product = [2, 3, 2, 2]
min_product = [2, 3, 2, 2]
For i = 2, calculate the maximum and minimum product of contiguous subarrays ending at position i.

max_product[i] = max(-2, max_product[1] * -2, min_product[1] * -2) = max(-2, 3 * -2, 3 * -2) = -2

min_product[i] = min(-2, max_product[1] * -2, min_product[1] * -2) = min(-2, 3 * -2, 3 * -2) = -6

After the second iteration, the lists become:

max_product = [2, 6, -2, 2]
min_product = [2, 3, -6, 2]
For i = 3, calculate the maximum and minimum product of contiguous subarrays ending at position i.

max_product[i] = max(4, max_product[2] * 4, min_product[2] * 4) = max(4, -2 * 4, -6 * 4) = 4

min_product[i] = min(4, max_product[2] * 4, min_product[2] * 4) = min(4, -2 * 4, -6 * 4) = -24

After the third iteration, the lists become:

max_product = [2, 6, -2, 4]
min_product = [2, 3, -6, -24]
After iterating through all elements, the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within nums is the maximum value in the max_product list, which is 4 for the given example.

The method returns max(max_product), resulting in an output of 6 for the given example.

By considering both positive and negative numbers and maintaining two separate lists for the maximum and minimum product
