A trio is said to be perfect if first element is less than second and second element is less than third .

You have given an array of integer you have to find how many such perfect trios are there in the array .

Example 1:

Input: 

arr = [3, 2, 1]

Output: 0

Explanation: There is no perfect trio.

Example 2:

Input:

 arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: 4

Explanation: Fours perfect trios are (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4) and (2, 3, 4).

def count_perfect_trios(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    count = 0

    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                if arr[i] < arr[j] and arr[j] < arr[k]:
                    count += 1

    return count

# Example 1
arr1 = [3, 2, 1]
print(count_perfect_trios(arr1))  # Output: 0

# Example 2
arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(count_perfect_trios(arr2))  # Output: 4
