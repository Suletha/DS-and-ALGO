Given a doubly linked list of n elements. The task is to reverse the doubly linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 3 <--> 4 <--> 5
Output: 5 4 3
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 75 <--> 122 <--> 59 <--> 196
Output: 196 59 122 75

def reverseDLL(head):
    #return head after reversing
    current = head
    prev = None
    while current:
            # Swap the prev and next pointers for the current node
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        current.prev = next_node

            # Move to the next node
        prev = current
        current = next_node

        # Update the new head of the list
    return prev
