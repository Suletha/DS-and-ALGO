Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the 
linked list is 5, which is its length.


        '''
class Solution:
    
    #Function to count nodes of a linked list.
    def getCount(self, head_node):
        #code here
        count = 0
        temp = head_node
        while temp != None:
            count += 1
            temp = temp.next
        return count
