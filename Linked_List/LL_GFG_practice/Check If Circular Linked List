Given head, the head of a singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not. A linked list is called circular if it not NULL terminated and all nodes are connected in the form of a cycle. An empty linked list is considered as circular.

Note: The linked list does not contains any inner loop.

def isCircular(head):
    # Code here
    temp = head
    while temp.next != None:
        temp = temp.next
        if temp == head:
            return True
    return False
