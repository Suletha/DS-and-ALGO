Given two Singly Linked List of N and M nodes respectively. The task is to check whether two linked lists are identical or not. 
Two Linked Lists are identical when they have same data and with same arrangement too.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList1: 1->2->3->4->5->6
LinkedList2: 99->59->42->20
Output: Not identical 
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList1: 1->2->3->4->5
LinkedList2: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: Identical

def areIdentical(head1, head2):
    # Code here
    current1 = head1
    current2 = head2
    while current1 and current2:
        if current1.data != current2.data:
            return False
        current1 = current1.next
        current2 = current2.next
    return current1 is None and current2 is None
