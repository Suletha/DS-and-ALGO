Given a linked list. Print all the elements of the linked list.

Note :- End of Line is handled by driver code itself. You just have to end with a single space.

Example 1:

Input:
N=2
LinkedList={1 , 2}
Output:
1 2



class Solution:
    def display(self,node):
        #code here
        temp = node
        while temp != None:
            print(temp.data, end = " ")
            temp = temp.next
