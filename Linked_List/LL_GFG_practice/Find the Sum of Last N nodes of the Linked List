Given a single linked list of size M, your task is to complete the function sumOfLastN_Nodes(), which should return the sum of last N nodes of the linked list.

Input:
The function takes two arguments as input, the reference pointer to the head of the linked list and the an integer N.
There will be T test cases and for each test case the function will be called seperately.

Output:
For each test case output the sum of last N nodes of the linked list.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=M<=1000

Example:
Input:
2
6 3
5 9 6 3 4 10
2 2
1 2

Output:
17
3

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Sum of last three nodes in the linked list is 3 + 4 + 10 = 17.



def sumOfLastN_Nodes(head,n):
    #function should return sum of last n nodes
    current = head
    length = 0
    while current:
        length += 1
        current = current.next

    # Calculate the position of the first node to include in the sum
    position = length - n + 1

    if position <= 0:
        return 0  # If N is greater than or equal to the length, return 0

    # Traverse the linked list to find the sum
    current = head
    current_position = 1
    result = 0

    while current:
        if current_position >= position:
            result += current.data

        current = current.next
        current_position += 1

    return result
