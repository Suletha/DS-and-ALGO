Given a String Extract all numbers from it and store it inside an array. Return the Array Once extraction is completed.
Note that if the string is "abc334vf" then the number is 334 and not 3,3,4 as individual numbers

Example 1:
Input:
str = "abc334v44d"
Output: [334, 44]
Example 2:
Input:
str = "abv345fjjf123tyir45jf6th"
Output: [345, 123, 45, 6]


class Solution:
    def extract_number(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        
        numbers = []
        current_number = ""
   
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                current_number += char
            elif current_number != "":
                numbers.append(current_number)
                current_number = ""

        if current_number != "":
            numbers.append(current_number)

        return numbers
