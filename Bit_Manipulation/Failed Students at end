In A exam with negative marking the passing criteria is you have to score zero or positive marks .
we have given an array which denotes the score of the students in that exam .

def move_failed_students(arr):
    passed_students = [score for score in arr if score >= 0]
    failed_students = [score for score in arr if score < 0]
    return passed_students + failed_students

# Example usage
arr = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6]
result = move_failed_students(arr)
print(result)
