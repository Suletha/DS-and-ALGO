You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

Example 1:
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6

def maximumWealth(accounts):
    max_wealth = 0                             # Initialize a variable to store the maximum wealth found so far.

                                               # Iterate through each customer's accounts.
    for customer_accounts in accounts:
                                               # Calculate the wealth of the current customer by summing their account balances.
        customer_wealth = sum(customer_accounts)

                                               # Update max_wealth if the current customer's wealth is greater.
        if customer_wealth > max_wealth:
            max_wealth = customer_wealth

    return max_wealth
