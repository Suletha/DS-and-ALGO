You are given an array Containing n-1 distinct numbers from range [1, n].
There is one element missing from the range[1,n] in the array. Find that missing Number and return it.


Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 8 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [1,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

class Solution:
    def missing_elements(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n=len(arr)+1
        exp_sum=n*(n+1)//2
        sum=0
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            sum=sum+arr[i]
        return exp_sum - sum
