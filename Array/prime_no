    flag = True                  # Assume 'x' is prime (flag = True).

            break                 # Exit the loop early since we already found a divisor.

    if flag == True:              # If the flag is still True, 'x' is a prime number.

# Initial values
a = []   # Empty list to store prime numbers.
x = 2    # Start checking for primes from 2.

# Iteration 1
x = 2
i = (No iteration as the loop doesn't execute)  # Since range(2, 2-1) generates an empty sequence, the for loop doesn't execute.
flag = True  # Since the loop didn't execute, 'flag' remains True.
a = [2]   # Since 'flag' is True, we append 'x' (which is 2) to the list 'a'.

# Iteration 2
x = 3
i = 2   # The for loop iterates over range(2, 3-1), which is equivalent to range(2, 2) -> [2].
flag = True  # Since 3 % 2 != 0, 'flag' remains True.
a = [2, 3]   # Since 'flag' is True, we append 'x' (which is 3) to the list 'a'.

# Iteration 3
x = 4
i = 2   # The for loop iterates over range(2, 4-1), which is equivalent to range(2, 3) -> [2].
flag = False  # Since 4 % 2 == 0, 'flag' becomes False, indicating 4 is not prime.
a = [2, 3]   # Since 'flag' is False, we do not append 'x' (which is 4) to the list 'a'.

# Iteration 4
x = 5
i = 2   # The for loop iterates over range(2, 5-1), which is equivalent to range(2, 4) -> [2, 3].
flag = True  # Since 5 % 2 != 0 and 5 % 3 != 0, 'flag' remains True.
a = [2, 3, 5]   # Since 'flag' is True, we append 'x' (which is 5) to the list 'a'.

# Iteration 5
x = 6
i = 2   # The for loop iterates over range(2, 6-1), which is equivalent to range(2, 5) -> [2, 3, 4].
flag = False  # Since 6 % 2 == 0, 'flag' becomes False, indicating 6 is not prime.
a = [2, 3, 5]   # Since 'flag' is False, we do not append 'x' (which is 6) to the list 'a'.

# The while loop stops here as len(a) (which is 3) is not less than n (which is 5).
# The final list 'a' contains the first 3 prime numbers: [2, 3, 5]
