arr = [10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67]
n=len(arr)

if n==1:
    print(0) 
if arr[0] >= arr[1]:
    print(0)
if arr[n-1] >= arr[n-2]:
    print(n-1)
for i in range(1,n):
    if arr[i] >= arr[i-1] and arr[i] >= arr[i+1]:

        if n == 1:
    print(0)
This checks if the length of the array is equal to 1. If it is, it means there is only one element in the array, and there's no other element to compare it with. In such a case, the code will print 0. 
However, this condition is not satisfied in our example because the length of the array is 7.

if arr[0] >= arr[1]:
    print(0)

This checks if the first element of the array is greater than or equal to the second element. If this condition is true, it means that the first element is greater than or equal to all elements to its right, so the code will print 0. 
In our example, this condition is not satisfied because arr[0] is 10, and arr[1] is 20, which means the first element is not greater than or equal to the second element.

if arr[n-1] >= arr[n-2]:
    print(n-1)
This checks if the last element of the array is greater than or equal to the second-to-last element. If this condition is true, it means that the last element is greater than or equal to all elements to its left, so the code will print n-1, which is the index of the last element in the array. In our example, this condition is satisfied because arr[6] (the last element) is 67, 
and arr[5] (the second-to-last element) is 90, which means the last element is greater than or equal to the second-to-last element
