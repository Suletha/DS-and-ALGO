Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].

Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].

class Solution:
    def shuffle(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums) //2
        shuffled_array = []
        for i in range(n):
            shuffled_array.append(nums[i])
            shuffled_array.append(nums[i+n])
        return shuffled_array


Let's take the array nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and n = 3.

n = len(nums) // 2:

In this example, len(nums) is 6, and n is calculated as 6 // 2, which is 3. The value of n represents the number of pairs in the array.
for i in range(n):

In this loop, i will take values from 0 to n-1, which means i will go from 0 to 2.
result.append(nums[i]) and result.append(nums[i + n]):

In the first iteration (when i = 0), we add nums[0] and nums[0 + 3] to the result list. So, result becomes [1, 4].
In the second iteration (when i = 1), we add nums[1] and nums[1 + 3] to the result list. So, result becomes [1, 4, 2, 5].
In the third iteration (when i = 2), we add nums[2] and nums[2 + 3] to the result list. So, result becomes [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6].
Final Result:
The final value of the result list is [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6], which is the desired arrangement of the elements from the original nums array. The odd-indexed elements (x1, x2, x3) come from the first half of the array, and the even-indexed elements (y1, y2, y3) come from the second half of the array.

The code essentially splits the original array into two halves (x and y elements), and then interleaves them to create the desired arrangement.
