You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:

                matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]

def rotate(matrix):: This line defines the function rotate that takes a 2D matrix matrix as input.

n = len(matrix): We find the size of the matrix (number of rows or columns) and store it in the variable n. In our example, n will be 3 since it's a 3x3 matrix.

for i in range(n):: This initiates the first loop that iterates over the rows of the matrix.

for j in range(i, n):: This initiates the second loop that iterates over the columns, but it starts from the current row index i to the end of the matrix n.

matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]: This line performs the transpose operation by swapping the elements at positions (i, j) and (j, i). 
This effectively rotates the elements along the main diagonal. For our example, after this line, the matrix becomes:

Let's consider the first iteration of the outer loop (for i in range(n)), where i = 0.

Now, we enter the second loop (for j in range(i, n)), where j will iterate from 0 to 2, since i = 0 and n = 3.

The first element to swap will be matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0]. However, since both indices are the same, this swap is essentially a no-op, and the elements remain unchanged.

Next, we swap matrix[0][1] and matrix[1][0]. So, matrix[0][1] gets the value 4 and matrix[1][0] gets the value 2. After this swap, the matrix becomes:

python
Copy code
matrix = [
    [1, 4, 3],
    [2, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
Now, we swap matrix[0][2] and matrix[2][0]. So, matrix[0][2] gets the value 7 and matrix[2][0] gets the value 3. After this swap, the matrix becomes:
python
Copy code
matrix = [
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 6],
    [3, 8, 9]
]
We continue with the second iteration of the outer loop (for i in range(n)), where i = 1.

Now, we enter the second loop (for j in range(i, n)), where j will iterate from 1 to 2, since i = 1 and n = 3.

The first element to swap will be matrix[1][1] and matrix[1][1]. Again, since both indices are the same, this swap is a no-op, and the elements remain unchanged.

Next, we swap matrix[1][2] and matrix[2][1]. So, matrix[1][2] gets the value 8 and matrix[2][1] gets the value 6. After this swap, the matrix becomes:

python
Copy code
matrix = [
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [3, 6, 9]
]
Finally, the loop continues with the third iteration of the outer loop (for i in range(n)), where i = 2. Since i = 2, the inner loop will not execute, as j will not be greater than or equal to n (which is 3).

At this point, the transpose operation is complete, and the matrix has been transposed along the main diagonal.

The transposed matrix is:

python
Copy code
[
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [3, 6, 9]
]
Now, we move on to the next step, 
which is to reverse each row to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.
Now, we swap matrix[0][2] and matrix[2][0]. So, matrix[0][2] gets the value 7 and matrix[2][0] gets the value 3. After this swap, the matrix becomes:
python
Copy code
matrix = [
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 6],
    [3, 8, 9]
]
We continue with the second iteration of the outer loop (for i in range(n)), where i = 1.

Now, we enter the second loop (for j in range(i, n)), where j will iterate from 1 to 2, since i = 1 and n = 3.

The first element to swap will be matrix[1][1] and matrix[1][1]. Again, since both indices are the same, this swap is a no-op, and the elements remain unchanged.

Next, we swap matrix[1][2] and matrix[2][1]. So, matrix[1][2] gets the value 8 and matrix[2][1] gets the value 6. After this swap, the matrix becomes:

python
Copy code
matrix = [
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [3, 6, 9]
]
Finally, the loop continues with the third iteration of the outer loop (for i in range(n)), where i = 2. Since i = 2, the inner loop will not execute, as j will not be greater than or equal to n (which is 3).

At this point, the transpose operation is complete, and the matrix has been transposed along the main diagonal.

The transposed matrix is:

python
Copy code
[
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [3, 6, 9]
]
Now, we move on to the next step, which is to reverse each row to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.
