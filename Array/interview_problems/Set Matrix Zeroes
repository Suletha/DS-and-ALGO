Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

You must do it in place.

class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])

        first_row_0 = any(matrix[0][j] == 0 for j in range(n))
        first_col_0 = any(matrix[i][0] == 0 for i in range(m))

        for i in range(1,m):
            for j in range(1,n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    matrix[i][0] = 0
                    matrix[0][j] = 0

        for i in range(1,m):
            for j in range(1,n):
                if  matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0:
                    matrix[i][j] = 0

        if first_row_0:
            for j in range(n):
                matrix[0][j] = 0

        if first_col_0:
            for i in range(m):
                matrix[i][0] = 0


first_row_zero = any(matrix[0][j] == 0 for j in range(n)): This line checks if there is any zero in the first row of the matrix.
In this example, n is the number of columns in the matrix, which is 3. So, the range for j will be range(3), which means j will take the values 0, 1, and 2.

Now, let's evaluate the generator expression matrix[0][j] == 0 for j in range(3):

When j is 0, matrix[0][0] is 1, which is not equal to 0.
When j is 1, matrix[0][1] is 1, which is not equal to 0.
When j is 2, matrix[0][2] is 1, which is not equal to 0.
Since there are no zeros in the first row, the generator expression results in [False, False, False]. The any() function checks if there is at least one True value in the list. Since all values are False, the any() function will return False.

So, in this case, first_row_zero will be False, indicating that there are no zeros in the first row.

first_col_zero = any(matrix[i][0] == 0 for i in range(m)): This line checks if there is any zero in the first column of the matrix.
In this example, m is the number of rows in the matrix, which is 3. So, the range for i will be range(3), which means i will take the values 0, 1, and 2.

Now, let's evaluate the generator expression matrix[i][0] == 0 for i in range(3):

When i is 0, matrix[0][0] is 1, which is not equal to 0.
When i is 1, matrix[1][0] is 1, which is not equal to 0.
When i is 2, matrix[2][0] is 1, which is not equal to 0.
Since there are no zeros in the first column, the generator expression results in [False, False, False]. The any() function checks if there is at least one True value in the list. Since all values are False, the any() function will return False.

So, in this case, first_col_zero will be False, indicating that there are no zeros in the first column.

In summary, for the given example, both first_row_zero and first_col_zero will be False, as there are no zeros in the first row or the first column of the matrix.

for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][0] = 0
                matrix[0][j] = 0 explain this with example

Certainly! Let's go through the code snippet with the example provided:

python
Copy code
matrix = [
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
]
for i in range(1, m):: This loop iterates through the rows of the matrix, starting from the second row (index 1). The purpose of starting from the second row is that we will use the first row and first column to mark which rows and columns need to be set to zeros. Therefore, we skip the first row in this loop.

for j in range(1, n):: This loop iterates through the columns of the matrix, starting from the second column (index 1). Similarly, we skip the first column in this loop for the same reason.

if matrix[i][j] == 0:: This condition checks if the current element at position (i, j) in the matrix is zero.

If the element at position (i, j) is zero, we mark the corresponding row and column by setting the first element of that row (matrix[i][0]) to zero and the first element of that column (matrix[0][j]) to zero.

Now, let's follow the loop execution step-by-step with the given example:

Initial state of the matrix:
csharp
Copy code
[
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 1]
]
i = 1, j = 1: The element at position (1, 1) is 0. So, we mark the first element of the second row and the first element of the second column as zeros:
csharp
Copy code
[
  [1, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 1]
]
i = 1, j = 2: The element at position (1, 2) is 1, so nothing changes.

i = 2, j = 1: The element at position (2, 1) is 1, so nothing changes.

i = 2, j = 2: The element at position (2, 2) is 0. So, we mark the first element of the second row and the first element of the second column as zeros:

csharp
Copy code
[
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 1]
]
Note that only the elements at positions (1, 1) and (2, 2) were zero, so only the second row and second column were marked as needing to be set to zeros.

At this point, the markers in the first row and first column have been set correctly. The first row and first column now indicate which rows and columns need to be updated to zeros based on the presence of zeros in the original matrix.

The next step is to use these markers to update the entire matrix, which is done in the subsequent loop in the original code.
